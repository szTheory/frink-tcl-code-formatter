Last Change 12 Dec 2002

Changes in 2.2.2

1) Lots of new tests and some new pragmas.

2) Allow the value after the -F flag to have a ! in front of it so that it
   can be negated (all tests except.....)

3) Added the -Q flag which will check for unquoted strings. it tries
   to be intelligent about this, but clearly there will be false
   positives. If one person finds one bug with the feature then
   it was worth all the false positives.. 

4) Fixed a few bugs too. Three are still some problems with variable
   name usage checking - these are not bugs per se, just places where
   it is rather hard to do the check (even if it looks easy to you!!)

5) Added package command to tcl command list

6) Move all the compilation control over to a GNU style configure set up.
   The old tcl setup was based on my program Obeah and was very out of date
   and people found it confusing to use. Using the configure stuff everything
   is much more automatic though mroe of the guts are exposed.

7) Fixed case where a global was used as an array to remove spurious
   warning

8) Fixed bug with parentheses inside conditions
	
Changes in 2.1.6

1) Changed some warning messages which were not as clear as they
   might be.

2) Removed the -C option as it was not being implemented!

3) Fixed a problem that arose when scanning multiple files (Thanks Stefan F.)

4) Added checking for bracketed elseif condition - was missing. Thanks Larry

5) Started to split the code up into more files - it was getting unwieldy.

Changes in 2.1.5

1) Update documentation and fixed typos (Thanks to Larry Virden for the nit picking)

2) Add continue checking

3) Add testing for abbreviated option names and warn about them.

Changes in 2.1.4

1) Unreachable code and infinite loops now working.

2) Doing 1 uncovered and fixed a case where some heuristics were not
   being applied.

Changes in 2.1.3

1) Fixed return handling in switches.

Changes in 2.1.2

1) Frink won't complain about a missing return in the case where you have
   something like if {a} { return b } { return c} at the end of a proc.

2) Added string replace command into list.

3) exit and error should now be handled better in a variety of cases.
   
4) return -1 is not detected as a missing flag case

5) -U flag will force switches with no default to be warned about as will the
   switch checking flag whose name I have forgotten.

6) unreachable code should be detected now.

Changes in 2.1.1

1) Removed support for frink.1 manual page - just providing HTML and text now.
   (if this is a problem then moan....). This just means that I can keep the
   documentation up to date much more easily!

2) Removed an unused documentation file

3) Now checks that you are passing variable names to regexp in the
   appropriate places.
   
4) Updated documentation.

5) Fix return value testing so that it always generates a line number

6) Partially fix some cases where a conditional or blocked return will
   prevent the return value test at the end of a proc
   
7) Add the -U flag which does various hardline enforcement - for instance
   it will always demand -- when it is a possibility

Changes in 2.1.0

0) Renamed this version to be 2.1 in preparation for other planned additions.

1) Fix some documentation bugs.

2) Commands global, unset, upvar and variable now get checked for variable
   name usage in the same way as set, append etc.
   
3) unset checks the sanity of any possible switches as the first parameter
   (8.4 compatibility test)
   
4) regexp switch testing is better and it will not complain about a missing
   -- when it frink can check that none is needed.

5) There was a bug in interp handling, which is now *not* done with a builtin
   procedure.
   
6) Added a flag to control checking of switches (-nocase etc. not switch statements)

7) Fixed a core dump when there was a bracing error in the code inside
   foreach statement. When the situation is detected frink will print a
   warning that things look a little odd....

Changes in 2.0.12

1) Added checking for -- in regexp calls

2) Updated documentation for heuristic test values - reused incr test
   for regexp.
   
3) I wonder when I added the -M flag for testing if switch statements had a --
   in them? Anyhow, it's there, though it ought to be one of the heuristic tests
   and not a flag.

4) Add an ifdef for FreeBSD malloc usage.

Changes in 2.0.11

1) Fix handling of string options that can take flags.

2) return was not handling -code/-error cases correctly with regard to
   heuristic testing.

Changes in 2.0.10

1) For the life of me I can't remember...

Changes in 2.0.9

1) Added -q flag

2) Noticed that the -a flag appears to do nothing at all.

Changes in 2.0.8

1) Slight restructuring of code for handling expr bracketing test.

2) Added expression tests in handling of tclX loop. Does anyone out there
   still use tclX I wonder?

Changes in 2.0.7

1) Fix bug when meeting foreach statements that have a same-line comment
   on the closing brace..... (Thanks Joachim for finding this)

2) Added warning of unbracketed conditions in if statements.

3) Added warning of unbracketed condition in while and expression in for
   statements. (Different path to the if case)

Changes in 2.06

1) Changed some exit(0) to be exit(1) - they were error conditions!

2) Frink will exit with a non-zero return code if there were any warnings
   during its tests. If you pass multiple files in then the return code will
   be non-zero if*any* of the files have warnings in them. Errors always cause
   the program to exit and not process any more files - is this the right
   behaviour I ask myself....

3) Added pragma information to the documentation files.

Changes in 2.0.5

1) Fix pragmas - they now seem to work. You use them thusly:

    # PRAGMA: nocheck
     set $ssss sss

   turns off the checks for the following line. If you replace nocheck
   with notreached or noformat, the obvious consequences ensue. If you
   don;t like PRAGMA: you can say FRINK:

Changes in 2.0.4

1) Now attempts to correctly detect array elements when testing for
   variable names. The test is pretty crude so it may get
   some wrong but it will get the most common cases.

Changes in 2.0.3

??

Changes in 2.0.2

??


Changes in 2.0.1

1) Too many to list....

Changes in 2.0

1) Renamed release to be 2.0 as the internal mechanisms have changed so much.

2) Frink is now driven internally using the same mechanism that allows you to
   add specs of other commands. I am intending to develop this so that it is
   more flexible.
   
3) Fixed some other bugs....

Changes in 1.3.4

1) Fixed line number problem with procs with continuations in them. Found
   horrible, similar problem with bodies that are strings rather than lists
   which is not yet fixed.

changes in 1.3.3

1) Added new -K flag. This allows you to specify a file that contains
   descriptions of tcl commands that you want specially formatted (for
   example your own special class commands). Look at the README file
   for information on what you can specify. These commands are searched
   for *before* the normal tcl ones so you can override the built-in
   stuff if you want.

changes in 1.3.2

1) extended foreach var nesting testing a bit.

2) added hex conversion of parameter to -F flag so you can now turn
   on and off individual heuristic tests.
   
3) started to add a PRAGMA system to embed heuristic control like lint does.
   I may add in some formatting control too.
   
4) Fix horrible -text and -label handling bug!!!

Changes in 1.3.1p1

1) Fixed line numbering bug. (Thanks Cary)

2) Added foreach var nesting check. (Rudimentary at the moment)

Changes in 1.3.1

1) Added support for return checking: if in a proc  you sometimes return
   results and sometimes don't frink will warn you.

2) Constant strings that get rewritten to msgcat format can be saved to a file.
   I've changed the usage of the -E flag so that you provide a locale name
   that indicates what language the strings are currently written in. The file
   created will be called <locale>.msg
   
3) Check that locale values passed to -E look correct.

Changes in 1.3.0

1) Moved up a version

2) Added heuristic testing

3) Fixed some potential bugs

4) Added rewriting for msgcat on -text and -label

Changes in 1.2p42

1) Changed body handling so that if the code body is held in a string
   rather than {} then frink does not attempt to process it as it is most
   likely that the code contains dynamic stuff which will cause it to break.
   I'm not 100% certain that this is the right thing to do yet, but we can see.

Changes in 1.2p41

1) Add -y flag to stop processing of -command options

Changes in 1.2p40

1) Add -H flag which will cause some heuristic tests to be made on the code.
   Currently this just involves checking the first parameter of append, incr
   and lappend to see if they have the form $dddd. More tests will be added
   as and when I think of them or people suggest them.
   
2) Add -J flag for "Just Test": generates no output and turns on the -H
   flag.

Changes in 1.2p39

1) Take out the condition optimising code. It was never finished and was
   only useful in a tcl 7 world.

Changes in 1.2p38

1) Stop removal of braces on conditions when minimising - this can cause
   things to break in some cases and it also turns off the expression compiler
   so is not a good idea.

Changes in 1.2p37

1) Add -N flag.

Changes in 1.2p36

1) Fix problem with { in strings

Changes in 1.2p35

1) I cant remember....

Changes in 1.2p34

1) Switch handler was not dealing with -- properly.

2) Fix bug with -p option - missing : in getopt statement

3) Improved handling of single line comments introduced by ;#. Where the
   # does not immediately follow the ; there is no special case.
   
4) Add some stuff to help people build frink under Windows (see the Windows
   sub-directory) - thanks to Jean-Michel Pedrono for this.

Changes in 1.2p33

1) Add -I flag so that elseif is treated like else.

Changes in 1.2p32

1) Fixed bug in interp handling.

2) Fixed general bug where frink dumped core if you used a command
   and gave it no parameters when some were expected.....

Changes in 1.2p31

1) Add includes to make malloc work with BSDI

Changes in 1.2p30

1) Forgot to handle case of \r after a line continuation character....

Changes in 1.2p29

1) Add handling for \r at the end of lines so that people can at least
   try to run the program on Windows machines....

Changes in 1.2p28

1) Add support for the uplevel command.

Changes in 1.2p27

1) Fix the stupid bug in 1.2p26.....

Changes in 1.2p26

1) Fix the stupid bug in p25 ......

Changes in 1.2p25

1) Add support for namespace and interp command.

Changes in 1.2p24

1) Fix a problem that showed up when using catch statements with an array
   element as the message variable. (The cause was deeper than this though).

Changes in 1.2p23

1) Change extra character checking to ignore ; and ) after a string as
   this can be OK in expressions and command lists. (Some errors will
   slip through now though)

2) Add parenthesis matching for expressions.

3) Add -A option to disable processing of expr commands.

Changes in 1.2p22

1) Improve check for extra characters after strings and lists.

Changes in 1.2p2[01]

1) Support for new foreach syntax.

2) Added -W flag that halts on a warning - thanks to Ross J. Reedstrom
   for this one.

3) Fixed a bug in handling of strings that start with # in certain
   contexts. (Again thanks to Ross Reedstrom for finding this - there
   may be other places where it happens that I haven't caught yet....)

4) Beginnings of some tcl optimisation code. This is enabled by the -E
   flag. Be warned that this is work in progress and you use it
   entirely at your own risk as it rewrites your code rather than just
   reformatting it!!!

Changes in 1.2p19

1) Fixed yet another comment handling problem....

Changes in 1.2p18

1) Fix horrible comment error introduced in P17

2) Fix obfuscation bug.

Changes in 1.2p17

1) Error message enhancements (Thanks to gregm)

2) More Correct (I hope) handling of tcl's bizarre \ handling rules. There
   are some cases I think where the formatting may not be quite what is wanted
   but these seem to come with the territory. There should be no buggy code
   produced though.

3) Memory leaks plugged. (several times.... Thanks to gregm for test cases)

4) Yet more storage allocation fixes.

5) Documentation fixes.

6) The -P option wasn't being recognised.

Changes in 1.2p16

1) Add time command processing (Thanks to Viktor Dukhovni)

2) Check for missing arguments to calls (Thanks to Viktor Dukhovni)

3) Some storage allocation fixes (Thanks to Viktor Dukhovni)

4) Fix comment handling problem in {}. Now preserves ;# comments. Comments
   inside code inside "" are still broken.

Changes in 1.2p15

1) Change default for -u flag.

2) Add processing of catch statement and -C flag to control it.

3) Change bind handling slightly to go for oneliners where possible.

Changes in 1.2p14

1) Change name of function lconv as it clashes in AIX4.1 (thanks to Zsolt
   Koppany)

2) Move include of malloc.h in tcl.c for HP systems (thanks to Zsolt Koppany)

3) Add -u flag

Changes in 1.2p13

1) Fixed not reading HOME/.frinkrc problem (thanks to John Ellson)

2) Fixed obfuscation problem with #! comment at start (spotted by John Ellson)

3) Fix tiny English problem in README to please Jim Wight...

Changes in 1.2p12

1) Fix problem with unescaped $ used not as starter of a variable name.

2) Allow for very long strings

3) Fix formatting error with strings longer than line and no spaces in them.

4) Fix problem with minimising while conditions.

5) Slight optimisation of previous case where the condition is a constant.
